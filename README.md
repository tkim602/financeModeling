# financeModeling (stock price prediction) 

## Introduction:
This repository is dedicated to building and improving a robust stock price prediction model using LSTM and other advanced machine learning techniques. The project aims to handle multiple stocks, extract meaningful features, and enhance prediction accuracy with continuous iteration and innovation.

I am constantly working on refining the model, expanding support for a broader range of stocks, and integrating advanced data-driven approaches to deliver more precise predictions. Contributions, suggestions, and collaborations are highly encouraged to make this project even better.

## Features: 
- Stock price prediction using LSTM.
- Data pre-processing for financial datasets.
- Model evaluation with metrics like RMSE and accuracy.
- Visualization of stock trends.

## Installation:
1. Clone the repository
   ```python
   git clone https://github.com/tkim602/financeModeling.git
   cd financeModeling
   ```
2. Set up a Python virtual environment
   ```python
   python3 -m venv stock_env
   source stock_env/bin/activate
   ```
3. Install the dependencies
   ```python
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
## Usage
1. Activate the virtual enviroment
   ```python
   source stock_env/bin/activate
   ```
2. Run the main script
   ```python
   python main.py
   ```
3. Modify the dataset or parameters as needed in the config/ directory.
