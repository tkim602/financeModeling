# financeModeling (stock price prediction) 

A basic machine learning project for stock market prediction and analysis using Python as a beginner. 

## Introduction:
The financeModeling project leverages machine learning and deep learning models to analyze and predict stock market trends. It uses libraries like TensorFlow and NumPy to process financial data and generate insights.

## Features: 
- Stock price prediction using LSTM.
- Data pre-processing for financial datasets.
- Model evaluation with metrics like RMSE and accuracy.
- Visualization of stock trends.

## Installation:
1. Clone the repository
   ```python
   git clone https://github.com/tkim602/financeModeling.git
   cd financeModeling
   ```
2. Set up a Python virtual environment
   ```python
   python3 -m venv stock_env
   source stock_env/bin/activate
   ```
3. Install the dependencies
   ```python
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
## Usage
1. Activate the virtual enviroment
   ```python
   source stock_env/bin/activate
   ```
2. Run the main script
   ```python
   python main.py
   ```
3. Modify the dataset or parameters as needed in the config/ directory.
